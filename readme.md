Aiming to write an anlysis bot for general game balance.

But to be specific - the bot is trained to play this spreadsheet game: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GByO1AY3V4jiArhLP2zuZcK1Y8CpZa2HUt1q8_2DRfA/edit#gid=1937081852

The app can be run on console:

```
python ./main.py
```

main contains logic to either run the Actor Critic Agent or run the game as an Actual Player
